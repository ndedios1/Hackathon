## Project Description
This project is a simple program that takes 3 three letter words and converts them to Ascii values that then become colors. Using an L-system, Jeff the Turtle then draws a picture created by the L-System using the colors.

***    
## Instructions
* First call the file, color.py <br />
* Enter in a three letter word (then do it two more times)<br />
* This should draw the l-System in three different colors.
* Try again with different words for different colors!!!
